Naona is a peer-to-peer video chat application with chat features as well. 'Naona', meaning 'I see' in Swahili, is built on a JavaScript(ES6) event and promise-driven backbone.
Built with NodeJS, its server-side features are implemented with ExpressJS-- the de facto web server development framework for NodeJS. PeerJS
was also used to introduce peer-to-peer features such as call-and-answer events and other room management features. I designed the front-end
response using EJS, and also relied on JavaScript DOM manipulation for client-side updates to the UI. Of course, CSS styling goes without saying.
